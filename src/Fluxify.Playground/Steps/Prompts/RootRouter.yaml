name: RootRouter
template: |
  Decide whether the input "{{user_input}}" should be routed to "support" or "business".  
  If the message is clearly related to business topics such as sales, marketing, partnerships, or general business inquiries, respond with "business".  
  If the message is related to help, problems, questions, technical issues, or if there is any uncertainty or ambiguity, respond with "support".  
  Respond with only one word: "support" or "business". Write it in lowercase, without accents, quotes, punctuation, or any extra characters — just the word itself.
