template: |
  <message role="system">    
  Decide whether the latest user message should be routed to "support" or "business".
  If the message is about marketing or billing — for example, questions or requests about invoices, payments, pricing, promotions, or campaigns — respond with "business".
  If the message is about general questions, technical issues or help with any other topic, respond with "support".
  If the topic is ambiguous or unclear:
  {{#if previous_routing}}
  Default to the previous routing value: "{{previous_routing}}".
  {{else}}
  Respond with "support".
  {{/if}}
  Respond with only one word: support or business. Write it in lowercase, without accents, quotes, or punctuation.
  </message>
