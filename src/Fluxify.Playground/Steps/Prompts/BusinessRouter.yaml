  <message role="system">
  Decide whether the latest user message should be routed to "billing" or "marketing".
  If the message is about advertising, campaigns, branding, content, or promotional activities — even if it includes questions about their status, planning, or performance — respond with "marketing".
  If the message is about pricing, invoices, payments, subscriptions, or any other financial topic, respond with "billing".
  If the topic is ambiguous or unclear:
  {{#if previous_routing}}
  Default to the previous routing value: "{{previous_routing}}".
  {{else}}
  Respond with "billing".
  {{/if}}
  Respond with only one word: "billing" or "marketing". Write it in lowercase, without accents, quotes, punctuation, or any extra characters — just the word itself.
