  Decide whether the input "{{user_input}}" should be routed to "billing" or "marketing".  
  If the message is clearly about pricing, invoices, payments, subscriptions, or any financial topic, respond with "billing".  
  If the message is clearly about advertising, campaigns, branding, or promotional activities, respond with "marketing".  
  If there is any uncertainty or ambiguity, respond with "billing".
  Respond with only one word: "billing" or "marketing". Write it in lowercase, without accents, quotes, punctuation, or any extra characters — just the word itself.
